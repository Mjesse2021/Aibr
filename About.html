                Previously the direct relations between customer and insurer was a single way of dealing with insurance
                business and as a result, the work volume for insurance companies grew beyond their capacity thereby
                compromising the quality of service thus prejudicing the interests and rights of customers.

                who has lost a relative knows how tiring it can be.

                    <p>
                        Like else where in the world, insurance brokers are established purposely to mitigate the insured who usually fall
                        victim to their insurers because of being in most times unskilled or less conversant with insurance issues.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the Government's quest to save the stuation, a ministerial instruction(earlier mentioned) purport that
                        insurance comapanies should pay commissions to the insurance brokers based on tariff fixed by the law to
                        enable them serve the insured expectedly. However, it should be understood that the commissions to paid to the insurance
                        brokers does not in anyway affect the premium paid by the insured.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Therefore the above explains how the insurance brokers are remunerated for the work thy do.
